      This assignment was undertaken as part of our second year Object-Oriented Programming module. As such, there was
      much more of a stress on the layout of our code – using the features of an OOP architecture to the best of our
      abilities. The full report of this assessment can be found
      <a href="../../assets/docs/Wally_Report.pdf">here</a>.
      <br />
      <br />
      Where’s Wally is one of the most well-renowned children’s book series worldwide. Our task was to implement a
      system which searched a large image file – a page from one of these books – and highlighted Wally in some way. We
      were given both the large scene and a reference Wally image as PGM files, to make it easier to manipulate the
      image in C++, and to allow us to focus on the solution of the problem at hand.
      This was performed with a Nearest Neighbour Search iterating through the main image file in sections the same size
      as the template image, with each iteration comparing how similar the section was to the original Wally file. The
      co-ordinates of the section most similar were logged and after the above process, this section was outlined in
      black & exported to a new PGM image.
      <br />
      <br />
      Although I am pleased with the resulting program from this assignment, I would say that this module, especially
      the report, was unfortunately one of the weaker pieces of coursework I have created.
