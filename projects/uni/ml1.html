    <p>
      This piece of work is the first out of two assignments that comprised the Machine Learning module of my third
      year. There were two sections, each focussing on different concepts in Machine Learning. The full PDF report can
      be found <a href="../../assets/docs/ML1_Report.pdf">here</a>.
      <br />
      One of the main challenges that created more of a struggle was the prohibition of purpose-built Machine Learning
      libraries such as SciKit Learn. This ensured that we created the algorithms essentially from the ground up.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5>Section 1: Polynomial Regression</h5>
    <p>
      This portion of the assignment was related to Polynomial Regression. Our main task was to accurately create and
      train a regression model, using Python, based on data from a CSV file. Since this task was the first that we were
      set in this module, the dataset we were given was relatively small, in addition to the input being only one
      dimensional.
      <br />
      <br />
      The approach I took to training this model was to use Least Squares regression. This requires the creation of a
      ‘Vandermonde matrix’, which was made a lot easier with the use of NumPy’s vander() function. After this the
      weights could be calculated using the equation
      <i>w=(X<sup>T</sup> X)<sup>-1</sup> X<sup>T</sup> y</i>,
      then are ready to be used with non-training data.
      <br />
      <br />
      The main advantage of using Polynomial over Linear Regression is that the resulting model can predict nonlinear
      patterns in data. By changing the ‘degree’, it is possible to predict results based on square, cubic or higher
      order polynomials.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5>Section 2: K-Means</h5>
    <p>
      The second task in this piece of coursework was to create a K-Means algorithm to cluster data into appropriate
      segments. This dataset contained four separate features related to measurements of dogs, such as tail length and
      height.
      <br />
      <br />
      K-Means is an unsupervised classification Machine Learning algorithm, meaning it does not require separating the
      data into training and testing sets, but rather the entire dataset is used. Classification models take a feature
      vector and generally return a single number, signifying which class, or cluster, the feature belongs to. These
      classes are normally then labelled manually, for example ‘Chihuahua’ or ‘Golden Retriever’.
      <br />
      <br />
      K-Means is an iterative algorithm which creates random co-ordinates to ‘centroids’, assigns each datapoint to the
      centroid it’s closest to and calculates the mean of all points for each centroid. This average result is then the
      new position of each centroid, and this process is repeated until the centroids are ‘stable’, and their position
      does not change. The final clusters are determined by which centroid each point is closest to, as before.
